Adding Methods to Laravel Query Builders

Laravel query builders are a powerful tool for interacting with databases. They provide a simple and expressive way to write complex SQL queries without having to write raw SQL.

While Laravel query builders provide a wide range of features, there may be times when you need to add your own custom methods. This can be useful for adding support for new features or for encapsulating complex logic.

To add a method to a Laravel query builder, you can create a custom query builder class. This class should extend the Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder class.

Once you have created your custom query builder class, you can add your custom methods to it. Your methods should be public and should return an instance of the Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder class.

For example, the following code shows a custom query builder class that adds a withCache() method:

```
namespace App\Builders;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

class ProductBuilder extends Builder
{
    public function withCache($cacheKey, $minutes = 60)
    {
        $results = Cache::remember($cacheKey, $minutes, function () {
            return $this->get();
        });

        return $results;
    }
}
```

To use the withCache() method, you would first need to instantiate a ProductBuilder object. You can then call the withCache() method, passing in the cache key and the number of minutes to cache the results.

For example, the following code would cache the results of the query for 60 minutes:

```
$products = ProductBuilder::withCache('products', 60);
```

You can then use the products variable as if you had executed the query directly.

Benefits of adding custom methods to Laravel query builders

There are a number of benefits to adding custom methods to Laravel query builders, including:

- Improved code readability and maintainability: Adding custom methods can make your code more readable and maintainable by encapsulating complex logic and providing a simpler way to interact with the database.
- Reduced code duplication: Custom methods can help to reduce code duplication by encapsulating common logic in one place.
- Improved performance: Custom methods can improve the performance of your application by caching the results of complex queries.

Best practices for adding custom methods to Laravel query builders

Here are some best practices for adding custom methods to Laravel query builders:

- Use descriptive names for your methods: This will make it easier to understand what your methods do and how to use them.
- Document your methods: This will help other developers to understand how to use your methods and what to expect.
- Test your methods: Make sure to test your methods thoroughly to ensure that they work as expected.
- Use caching for complex queries: If you are adding a method that executes a complex query, consider using caching to improve performance.
